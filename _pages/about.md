I am a research data scientist based in Philadelphia, PA. My research is focused on investigating the genetic architecture of substance use and psychiatric disorders by leveraging electronic health record-linked biobank data. I am interested in a wide range of applications and research problems at the intersection of mental health and precision medicine including drug repurposing, integrative omics and developing tools for clinical decision making.
