I am a computational research scientist based in Philadelphia, PA. My current research is focused on investigating the genetic architecture of substance use and psychiatric disorders by leveraging electronic health record-linked biobank data. I am interested in a wide range of applications and research problems in precision medicine including drug repurposing, integrative omics and developing tools for clinical decision making.
