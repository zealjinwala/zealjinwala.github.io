# 👋🏼 Hi, I'm Zeal. 

I am a computational genomics research scientist based in Philadelphia, PA. 

My current research is focused on investigating the genetic architecture of substance use and psychiatric disorders by leveraging population data from electronic health record-linked biobanks. I am interested in a wide range of applications and research problems in precision medicine including drug repurposing, integrative omics and developing tools for clinical decision making. My early background in biomedical engineering and sequencing research helps me bring a unique perspective in understanding the abstract intricacies and anamolies of genetic data.
